# E-commerce Sales and Customer Insights

## Executive Summary

This report dives into customer behavior, product performance, and overall satisfaction within a fictional e-commerce platform. Using SQL for data analysis, I was able to pinpoint insights that can boost customer satisfaction and refine sales strategies. The analysis shows that Apple AirPods Pro stands out as the top revenue-generating product, highlighting its high demand and popularity. Additionally, the report found a 25% order cancellation rate, signaling room for improving fulfillment processes. These findings aim to help stakeholders make informed decisions that foster revenue growth and improve customer retention.

## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced e-commerce landscape, understanding customer behavior and product performance is key to staying competitive. This report examines different aspects of sales data on the platform, using SQL to uncover meaningful insights. By identifying trends, challenges, and opportunities, the analysis provides strategic recommendations to boost customer satisfaction and enhance sales. A deeper understanding of customer behavior and product performance informs immediate decisions and supports long-term planning, helping the business stay proactive in meeting customer needs and adapting to market demands.

## Data Sources

The analysis utilized several datasets (tables) generated by ChatGPT for the fictitious e-commerce platform, which included:

- **Categories:** Provides product categories, helping identify high-performing product types and growth opportunities.
- **Customers:** Contains customer demographics, enabling segmentation by spending habits and purchase frequency for targeted marketing.
- **Order Items:** Details individual items in orders, supporting analysis of product popularity and sales performance.
- **Orders:** Includes order status and timestamps, revealing sales trends and fulfillment efficiency, including cancellation rates.
- **Product Reviews:** Offers customer ratings and feedback, highlighting areas for product improvement based on satisfaction levels.
- **Products:** Contains product information, allowing correlation of product features with sales and customer satisfaction.

## Schema

The schema diagram represents the connections among six tables in the e-commerce database: **Customers, Orders, Order_Items, Products, Product_Reviews,** and **Categories.**

![schema](https://github.com/Ade-Ogunbiyi/E-Commerce-Sales-and-Customer-Insights/blob/main/e_commerce_schema_diagram.pgerd.png)

1. **Customers and Orders:** Each customer can place multiple orders, establishing a one-to-many relationship between the Customers and Orders tables through the `customer_id`.
2. **Orders and Order_Items:** An order can include one or more items, creating a one-to-many relationship between them via the `order_id`.
3. **Order_Items and Products:** The Order_Items table references the Products table, linking each item in an order to a specific product through the `product_id`.
4. **Products and Categories:** Every product is associated with a single category, resulting in a many-to-one relationship from Products to Categories via the `category_id`.
5. **Product_Reviews and Products:** The Product_Reviews table is connected to the Products table by the `product_id`, indicating a one-to-many relationship where each product can receive multiple reviews.
6. **Product_Reviews and Customers:** Product_Reviews connects to Customers through the `customer_id`, enabling each customer to submit multiple reviews.

This relational framework supports the analysis of customer behavior, order trends, product performance, and review patterns, laying the groundwork for data-driven insights.

## Tools Used

The analysis was conducted using:

**PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system that facilitates data querying and manipulation.
- **SQL:** Structured Query Language was employed to extract insights from the datasets.
- **ChatGPT:** Utilized to generate data and assist in the analysis process, providing valuable suggestions and insights.

## SQL Functions Used

The analysis leveraged various SQL functions, including:

- **SELECT:** To retrieve specific data from tables.
- **JOIN:** To combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.
- **GROUP BY:** To aggregate data for analysis.
- **COUNT():** To calculate the number of occurrences.
- **SUM():** To compute total revenue or sales figures.
- **AVG():** To determine average ratings.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Used to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. CTEs help in organizing complex queries, improving readability, and enabling recursive queries.
